foo-lang

This repository contains the sources for foo-lang, as well as its website.
See http://foo-lang.org for more information.

+ disclaimer

  I'm happy working on my Mac. This also means that the repository is based on
  this environment. Currently instructions or example instructions are therefore
  also targetting this platform.

  That being said, make sure that...
  $ which python
  /usr/bin/python

  $ python --version
  Python 2.7.5

  I use MacPorts for installation of general purpose tools and for Python
  started to use pip (in stead of easy_install).
  $ sudo easy_install pip

+ setup

  For the development of foo-lang the following pre-requisites are needed:

  - coverage
    $ sudo pip install coverage
  - antlr3 is included in lib/
  - antlr3 Python runtime
    download http://www.antlr3.org/download/Python/antlr_python_runtime-3.1.3.zip
    unzip
    $ cd antlr_python_runtime-3.1.3/
    $ sudo python setup.py install
  - stringtemplate3
    $ sudo pip install stringtemplate3
  - antlr-2.7
    See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5198902/ especially the comments on
    why we need to do this :-(
    download http://www.antlr2.org/download/antlr-2.7.7.tar.gz
    unarchive
    $ cd antlr-2.7.7/lib/python/
    $ sudo python setup.py install
  - dot from GraphViz
    $ sudo port install graphviz
  - astyle
    $ sudo port install astyle

  Executing make in the top-level foo-lang repository directory should now work.
