This directory contains platform specific implementations of certain foo-lib
modules. More specifically for the moose platform.

The Makefile expects an ATMEGA1284p micro-controller (mcu), programmable
through a JTAG interface, with an LED connected to PB0 and wired to a serial
connection connected to USART1.

The default target of the Makefile will build and program the mcu. After
linking the serial connection to a terminal, the output shows:

  *** performing all tests for moose implementation of foo-lib...
  --- testing time
  *** SUCCESS
