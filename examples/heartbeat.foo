// example implementation of heartbeat detection algorithm.
// this file includes extensive comments to clarify the DSL and some of the
// inner workings of the code generator.

// explicit declaration of module, allows for multiple modules in a source file
module heartbeat

// define constants to configure the solution. types are inferred from the
// value (integer, float (with .), boolean (true/false), "string", 'atom')
// or can be explicited using the ": <type>" typing information

const max_last_seen_interval = 1000    // 1 sec
const max_fail_count         =    3    // 3 strikes and you're out
const validation_interval    = 5000    // check nodes every 5 seconds

// imports general purpose functionality. this is done explicit to avoid lookup
// through all possible collections of functions. function collections are
// simple C modules of which the public functions can be called.
// importing functions require full typing of the prototype

// modules can be extended. the implications can differ. here the internal
// representation of a node is extended with some properties that are specific
// to this algorithm. the nodes module already implements things like unique
// identification of nodes. internal modification of the module allows for
// different network stacks and properties to be implemented (e.g. Zigbee,...)
// from the outside (=here), all this is abstracted into nodes in general.
// the format is a simple hash of <name> : <type> = value's

// note: the nodes module keeps track of all nodes it encounters. the very first
// node is our own node, which can be referenced through nodes.self

// we can interact with the module through event handlers and extensions.
// extensions are functions that are added to the nodes and are linked to events
// or have an execution strategy.
// event handlers are triggered when certain events happen within the scope of
// nodes. typically this consists of existing functions that are executed. the
// registered event handler will then be called with the same arguments. think
// of it as kind of aspect-programming meets event handling, because using
// the @before and @after annotations, the event handler can kick in before
// or after the event will happen - premonition anyone :-)

// every node is validated using this function at the validation_interval.
